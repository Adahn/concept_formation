Instance Representation
=======================

Here we will describe instances. There are a couple of main points to cover:
    * Nominals
    * Numerics
    * Relations
    * Components 
    * Unbound attribute names ('?')
    * Hidden attribute names ('_')
    * What type of tree supports which format.
