This is a python library of algorithms that perform concept formation written by
Christopher MacLellan (http://www.christopia.net).  

In this library, the COBWEB
(http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/678/Papers/Fisher_Cobweb.pdf) and
COBWEB/3
(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.4676&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
algorithms are implemented. The system accepts a stream of instances, which are
represented as hash tables of attributes and values (where values can be both
numeric and nominal), and learns a concept hierarchy.

Current plans are to extend this library to include the LABYRINTH
(http://www.isle.org/~langley/papers/labyrinth.cfb.pdf) algorithm for learning
structured concepts with relations and components.
