This is a python library of algorithms that perform concept formation written by
Christopher MacLellan (http://www.christopia.net).  

Currently only COBWEB
(http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/678/Papers/Fisher_Cobweb.pdf) is
implemented. The system accepts a stream of instances, which are represented as
hash tables of attributes and values, and learns a concept hierarchy.

Current plans are to extend this library to include
LABYRINTH (http://www.isle.org/~langley/papers/labyrinth.cfb.pdf) algorithm for
learning structured concepts with relations and components.
